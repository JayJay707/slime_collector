# Slime Collector
> A small text-based game played in the terminal where you can collect and evolve slimes of all kinds.

## Introduction

Slime Collector is a small game where you collect slimes. I've always liked collecting things and I love slimes and since there aren't many games where you can collect slimes, I decided to create my own.
The game is simple: explore the world, feed slimes until they evolve, and collect all types of slimes. It's important to note that there is no save function because I wanted users to have a unique experience each time they played, since there isn't much to the game yet. I intend to continue developing this game in the future.
